# SEE-2018, Find Animal Sounds in a Noisy Kelp Forest Exhibit


This is exhibit was built by Summer Experience at EnVision 2018 interns.
It is currently a property of Birch Aquarium, more description will be added later.

## Getting Started

You can fork this repository or download the .zip file.

### Prerequisites

Arduino libraries that are used for this exhibit are under /libraries folder

```
FastLED-3.2.0
WAV-Trigger-Arduino-Serial-Library-master
```
Put these two libraries under your Arduino folder.

### Installing

Once you have downloaded the necessary files, open up Arduino IDE and connect it to the Arduino.
For this version of exhibit, it is required to use Arduino Mega 2560.
Then upload the code to the Arduino.

## Running the tests

When you start the program and open up Serial Monitor (9600), you will see this message.
```
Beginning Exhibit Arduino v1.0
------------------------------
```

When you see this message,
```
Finished Setup
```
it means the Arduino and WAVTrigger is all set.

## Deployment

Upload this code to the Arduino with WAV Trigger.

## Built With

* [WAV Trigger](https://github.com/robertsonics/WAV-Trigger-Arduino-Serial-Library) - The WAV Trigger library
* [FastLED](http://fastled.io/) - Library for LED strip.
