One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

You can for this repository or download the .zip file.

### Prerequisites

Arduino libraries that are used for this exhibit are under /libraries folder

```
FastLED-3.2.0
WAV-Trigger-Arduino-Serial-Library-master
```
Put these two libraries under your Arduino folder.

### Installing

Once you have downloaded the necessary files, open up Arduino IDE and connect it to the Arduino.
For this version of exhibit, it is required to use Arduino Mega 2560.
Then upload the code to the Arduino.

## Running the tests

When you start the program and open up Serial Monitor (9600), you will see this message.
```
Beginning Exhibit Arduino v1.0
------------------------------
```

When you see this message,
```
Finished Setup
```
it means the Arduino and WAVTrigger is all set.
